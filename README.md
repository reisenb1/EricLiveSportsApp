# EricLiveSportsApp
This app makes API calls to sportspage-feeds.p.rapidapi.com to provide sports data. Main goal is to provide past and live scores, but may expand to include other data. Currently, this is simply a CLI app, but may expand to include a GUI front-end with Vue.js or other front-end framework.
